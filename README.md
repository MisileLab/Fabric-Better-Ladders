# Better Ladders

This mod has one single purpose:\
It changes the vanilla ladder model to be 3D and placeable anywhere without any supporting blocks. No need to mess around with barrier blocks anymore.

If the ladder is placed against a supporting block, the ladder is placed against its surface like in vanilla.\
If there is no supporting block, the ladder faces the direction of the player

Destroying supporting blocks does not destroy the attached ladder anymore!

# Additional Info

- the 3D model is just an internal resource pack change, other resource packs that change the texture of the ladder will work with the 3D model
- removing the mod completely will still keep the floating ladders in your world, only a block update by placing a block where the vanilla ladder expects a 'supporting block' will make the ladder pop off
